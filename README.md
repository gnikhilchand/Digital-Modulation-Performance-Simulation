BER Performance Simulation of Digital Modulation Schemes
This project provides a Python-based simulation to analyze and visualize the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of several fundamental digital modulation schemes‚ÄîBPSK, QPSK, and 16-QAM‚Äîover an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel.

The simulation results are plotted against the theoretical BER curves to validate the implementation and demonstrate the trade-offs between spectral efficiency and noise immunity for each scheme.

Core Concepts üì°
Digital Modulation: The process of encoding digital data (bits) onto an analog carrier signal.

BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying): Encodes 1 bit per symbol by shifting the phase of the carrier wave between two states (0¬∞ and 180¬∞). It is robust but not spectrally efficient.

QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying): Encodes 2 bits per symbol using four phase states. It offers double the data rate of BPSK for the same bandwidth.

16-QAM (16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation): Encodes 4 bits per symbol using 16 distinct states by varying both the phase and amplitude of the carrier. It is highly spectrally efficient but more susceptible to noise.

AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise): A channel model that simulates the effect of random, thermal noise that is always present in communication systems.

E_b/N_0 (Energy per Bit to Noise Power Spectral Density Ratio): A normalized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric. It is the standard way to compare the performance of different modulation schemes, as it measures the signal energy per bit against the noise power.

BER (Bit Error Rate): The ultimate measure of performance, defined as the number of bit errors divided by the total number of transmitted bits. A lower BER indicates a more reliable system.

How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
The simulation follows a standard digital communication system pipeline for each E_b/N_0 point:

Bit Generation: A large stream of random binary bits (0s and 1s) is generated to serve as the source data.

Modulation (Symbol Mapping): The bits are grouped and mapped to complex-valued symbols according to the rules of the selected modulation scheme (BPSK, QPSK, or 16-QAM). The average symbol energy is normalized to 1 for a fair comparison.

Channel Simulation: The complex symbols are passed through an AWGN channel. This is simulated by adding complex Gaussian noise, where the variance of the noise is calculated directly from the current E_b/N_0 value.

Demodulation (Decision Making): The receiver processes the noisy symbols and makes a decision to recover the original bits.

For BPSK/QPSK, this involves checking the sign/quadrant of the received symbol.

For 16-QAM, a minimum distance decoder is used, which finds the closest valid constellation point to the received symbol.

BER Calculation: The recovered bits are compared with the originally transmitted bits, and the number of errors is counted to calculate the BER.

Plotting: The final simulated and theoretical BER values are plotted on a semi-logarithmic graph against the E_b/N_0 range.

How to Run
Prerequisites
You will need the following Python libraries:

numpy

matplotlib

scipy

You can install them using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

Execution
To run the simulation and generate the plot, execute the script from your terminal:

python digital_modulation_simulation.py

The script will print the current E_b/N_0 value it is simulating and will display the plot upon completion.
